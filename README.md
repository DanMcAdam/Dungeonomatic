# Dungeonomatic
A procedural tile-based dungeon generator for Unity Developers 

Currently in active development. All relevant files are found in "Assets/Dungeonomatic Core Scripts/". A detailed readme with implementation instructions will be added after the next major update, which will refactor old test/debug code so it can be more cleanly used outside of the current project.
